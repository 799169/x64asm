1. Some instruction (ex?) require a fully specified memory width type for disambiguation.
   Otherwise, we would simplify all memory operands to the base type M.
	
2. LAHF and SAHF are conditionally invalid in 64-bit mode (I've opted to keep them valid).

4. Added underscores to naming convention for rep instructions:

5. Any instruction prefixed with REX+ is referring to 8bit operands.
   Basically, if you use ABCD-H as an 8-bit operand, you can only use ABCD-H or ABCD-L as the other (if you can at all).





ISA Notes:

CMPS/CMPSB/CMPSW/CMPSD/CMPSQ:
	Memory argument for CMPS is for documentation, disambiguates to later cases.
	The word case requires an implicit 66 prefix.
	*A 67 prefix can be used to demote addresses to 32 bits.

CWD/CDQ/CQO
	CWD requires an implicit 66 prefix to distinguish it from CDQ

INS/INSB/INSW/INSD:
	Memory argument is for documentation, disambiguates to later cases.A
	They word case requires an implicit 66 prefix.
	* A 67 prefix can be used to demote addresses to 32 bits.

IRET/IRETD/IRETQ
	You would THINK that you'd need a 66 prefix to disambiguate IRET and IRETD, but they're the same.

LEAVE:
	The word case requires an implicit 66 prefix.
	There's no way to distinguish this by mnemonic so we add an override argument

LODS/LODSB/LODSW/LODSD/LODSQ
	Memory argument for LODS disambiguates to later cases.
	The word case requires an implicit 66 prefix.
	* The manual makes no mention of downgrading to 32 bit addresses here.
	* I'm assuming that this is a typo.

MOV
	A rex prefix is allowed on movabs al [mem]/movabs [mem] al.
	No idea what it does or how to get it with gcc, but the mnemonic can't disambiguate this case.
	Add an override argument.

MOVS/MOVSB/MOVSW/MOVSD/MOVSQ
	Memory arugment is for documentation, disambiguates to later cases.
	The word care requires an implicit 66 prefix.
	* A 67 prefix can be used to downgrade to 32 bit addresses.

TODO:
	Add support for implicit 67 prefix to string instructions.
	Note that in the documentation argument mode, you get this out of the memory operand.
	I think my official policy is that if you want this behavior, you should use the explicit operand version.

	REMEMBER: You will need 66 prefixes for ALL 16-bit operand instructions.
	          r16/m16/AX/... more?
